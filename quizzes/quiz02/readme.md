For this home assignment, you will need to look for a shapefile (polygon) and convert it to geojson and topojson. It would be great if this data can be used for your final project. For this assignment, you need to:

[1] Convert the raw geospatial data as a geojson;

[2] Simplify this geojson as a new geojson data; and

[3] Convert the simplified geojson as a typojson.

In the readme.md file of this repo, please briefly introduce this data, and also make a table to compare the data size of these three (geo/topo)-json files. for example:

name	size(kb)
xxx.geojson	10,000
xxx_simplifed.geojson	1,000
xxx.topojson	50
In the assets folder of this repo, please upload the three json files.  So, the structure of this repository should be: 

```powershell
[your_repository_name]
    │readme.md
    ├─assets
    │      XXX.geojson 
    │      XXX_simplified.geojson
    │      XXX.topojson
```

Please only submit the url of this repository to canvas.
