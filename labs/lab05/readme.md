This lab will help you make a storymap using an open-source library `storymap.js` and share it to GitHub.


With this storymap exercise, you are asked to introduce something about Corvallis or Oregon which you feel interested in. For example, the topic can vary from your favorite restaurants in Corvallis, your favorite bookstores in Town, to the snow mountains in Oregon, and etc.

In Practical Exercise 4, you have made a Corvallis basemap and web map & feature services as the side products. You may use them to enrich the storymap.

To make the storymap, you need to use a web map library `storymap.js` at [https://github.com/jakobzhao/storymap](https://github.com/jakobzhao/storymap). There is a detailed tutorial on the [front page](https://github.com/jakobzhao/storymap) of that library.  The handouts for lecture 15, 16, 17 also help.

Your storymap will at least have the following features:

- At least five scenes. The content of the scenes can be obtained from Yelp or Wikipedia, or even writing up by yourself. If you would like to use an external source, please do credit it in the `about page`; (**15 POINTS**)
- At least two types of thematic layers (to name a few, tileLayer, geojson/WFS Layer, OSM Layer, WMS Layer and etc.). These thematic layers can be made by yourself or included from other map providers; (**15 POINTS**)
- An about page; and (**5 POINTS**)
- A favicon;
- A social media button to share the storymap to Facebook. (**5 POINTS**)

>  **Note**: If you can add some extra features other than the ones I listed above, you will earn some bonus credits (**10 POINTS maximum**).
